# First Step
+ Person(body) detection
+ Tracking
+ Pose estimate - alpha pose
  + Detect skeleton.
  + Mapping with track.
  + Draw skeleton.
+ Action recognition.

## Deep into model
### Pose estimate
+ In the futures
### Action recognition.
+ ST-GCN(Spatial Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks) has transferred to [MMSkeleton](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmskeleton)
+ Spatial Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks for Skeleton-Based Action
Recognition [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07455.pdf).
+ Data :
  + Before training and testing, for convenience of fast data loading, the datasets should be converted to proper file structure.
